	abstract = {This easy-to-use, fast-moving tutorial introduces you to functional programming with Haskell. You'll learn how to use Haskell in a variety of practical ways, from short scripts to large and demanding applications. Real World Haskell takes you through the basics of functional programming at a brisk pace, and then helps you increase your understanding of Haskell in real-world issues like I/O, performance, dealing with data, concurrency, and more as you move through each chapter. With this book, you will: * Understand the differences between procedural and functional programming * Learn the features of Haskell, and how to use it to develop useful programs * Interact with filesystems, databases, and network services * Write solid code with automated tests, code coverage, and error handling * Harness the power of multicore systems via concurrent and parallel programming You'll find plenty of hands-on exercises, along with examples of real Haskell programs that you can modify, compile, and run. Whether or not you've used a functional language before, if you want to understand why Haskell is coming into its own as a practical language in so many major organizations, Real World Haskell is the best place to start.},

You'll work with several samples to explore the way Yesod handles widgets, forms, persistence, and {RESTful} content. You also get an introduction to various Haskell tools to supplement your basic knowledge of the language. By the time you finish this book, you'll create a production-quality web application with Yesod's ready-to-use scaffolding. You'll also examine several real-world examples, including a blog, a wiki, a {JSON} web service, and a Sphinx search server. Build a simple application to learn Yesod's foundation datatype and Web Application Interface ({WAI}); Use Shakespearean template languages for {HTML}, {CSS}, and Javascript output; Produce cleaner, more modular code by learning how Yesod monads interact; Implement the yesod-form declarative {API} to build forms on top of widgets; Learn how Yesod and Haskell store session data and handle persistence; Use techniques to serve an {HTML} page and a machine-friendly {JSON} page from the same {URL}; Create reusable components for several applications with Yesod subsites"--Publisher description Ebook edition available in several {DRM}-free electronic formats, including {PDF}, {EPUB}, Mobi, {APK}, and Daisy}
