# Summary

The goal of this thesis was to give a brief introduction to the Star-Exec-Presenter, a web-based application for data-mining results from StarExec. At first, I gave an introduction to the _Termination Community_ and its subject, the _Termination of Term Rewriting_. I explained _StarExec_ and its functionalities in terms of our tool and listed the _Use Cases_ which we wanted to be more accessible. The _Requirements_ defined the foundation of the _Design_ of Star-Exec-Presenter and its _Implementation_. In the _Evaluation_ I tried to be self-critical in what I achieved with this whole project and gave _Future Consideration_ how our tool can evolve in preparation of the next Termination Competition or a possible utilization by another community.
