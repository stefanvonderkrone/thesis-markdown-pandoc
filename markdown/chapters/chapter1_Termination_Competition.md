# Termination Competition

In this chapter I will discuss the terms of Termination and Termination of Term Rewriting. I also will describe the Termination Competition, as its 2014 incarnation was one of the goals towards the Star-Exec-Presenter was developed.

## Termination of Term Rewriting

<!-- 
* example of a term rewriting system (maybe from TPDB itself)
* alternative to turing machines
* termination means, every term rewriting system has base case
    * possible example: pattern matching recursion in Haskell
