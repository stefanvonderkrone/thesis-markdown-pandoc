# Implementation

The Star-Exec-Presenter is a web application written in Haskell and based upon the Yesod Web Framework. In this chapter I will talk about the actual implementation of the tool as well as about the benefits of using especially Haskell and Yesod.

## Haskell

_"Haskell is a general purpose, purely functional programming language incorporating many recent innovations in programming language design. Haskell provides higher-order functions, non-strict semantics, static polymorphic typing, user-defined algebraic datatypes, pattern-matching, list comprehensions, a module system, a monadic I/O system, and a rich set of primitive datatypes, including lists, arrays, arbitrary and fixed precision integers, and floating-point numbers. Haskell is both the culmination and solidification of many years of research on non-strict functional languages."_ [@peyton_jones_haskell_2003]

This quote is from "The Haskell 98 Report"

Haskell is a general-purpose purely functional programming language which provides non-strict semantics and a strong static and expressive type system. [@peyton_jones_haskell_2003] It first appeared in 1990 and was invented bei a group of computer scientists like Simon Peyton Jones or Erik Meijer. It inherits from the lambda calculus and is named after the mathematician and logician Haskell Curry.
