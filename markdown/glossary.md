# Glossary

**AJAX**

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, a technique to update a web-page without fully reloading it by fetching only the needed data.

**Algebraic Datatype**

A datatype created by the algebraic operations of _sum_ and _product_.[^adt]

[^adt]: see https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Algebraic_data_type

**API**

Application Programming Interface, a set of components (methods, protocols, tools) for using a software.

**Benchmark**

A certain problem to be processed by a solver.

**Caching**

A fast store to put data in, that can then be requested much faster.

**CSS**

Cascading StyleSheet, a textbased format to describe the appearence of HTML.

**CSV**

Comma Seperated Values, a textbased format that describes a table mit its content. Each column is seperated by a comma or an otherwise specified seperator.

**DSL**

Domain Specific Language, a programming language to serve a certain purpose. A DSL is often less powerfull than a general purpose programming language.

**GUI**

Graphical User Interface, a special type of interface which a user can actually see and use.

**Haskell**

A purely functional programming language with an expressive type system that supports type inference, pattern matching and lazy evaluation.

**Higher-Order Function**

A function that can be treated like data und therefore can be passed round.

**HTML**

HyperText Markup Language, a structural textbased language to describe content which will be interpreted and displayed by a web-browser.

**HTTP**

HyperText Transfer Protocoll, a standard way to communicate with the aid of a web browser.

**JavaScript**

A dynamic programming language originally created for dynamic content in web browsers. It serves imperative as well as functional programming paradigms.

**Job**

A complex task on StarExec, that starts solvers and stores their results.

**Job-Pair**

A unique combination of a certain benchmark and a certain solver within a job. It contains the actual output of a solver according to the processed benchmark.

**JSON**

JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data-interchange format originally specified by Douglas Crockford. It is a subset of JavaScript as well as a human-readable data-format.[^json_org]

[^json_org]: see http://www.json.org/

**Lazy Evaluation**

A non-strict evaluation strategy, expecially used by Haskell. An expression won't be evaluated until it is really needed, e.g. for output.[^lazy_eval]

[^lazy_eval]: see https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Lazy_evaluation

**Monad**

An abstract datatype, that wraps a (primitive) value in a context and binds it to a function operating within that context.

**MVC**

Model View Controller, a software design pattern where data, logic and presentation are seperated from each other.

**Pattern Matching**

A rich programming technique to identify certain cases for a given expression. It helps simplifying code by reducing the usage of if-statements and alike.[^pattern_matching]

[^pattern_matching]: see https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/patterns.html

**REST**

Representational state transfer, a paradigm to implement a server-client communication.[@fielding_architectural_2000]

**StarExec**

A cross community logic solving service developed at the University of Iowa.[^star_exec]

[^star_exec]: see https://www.starexec.org/starexec/public/about.jsp

**Star-Exec-Presenter**

A Haskell web application to data mining, displaying and querying competition results from StarExec.

**SOAP**

Simple Object Access Protocol, a network protocol for data-interchange between remote systems.

**Solver**

A tool that processes a benchmark on StarExec.

**SQL**

A relational database query language.

**STM**

Software Transactional Memory, a mechanism for concurrent programming with shared resources.

\pagebreak

**Termination**

The final state of a programm, with which a programm ends if it ends.

**Termination Community**

An international group of developers and researchers working in the field of Termination of Term Rewriting.[^term_portal]

[^term_portal]: see http://www.termination-portal.org/wiki/Main_Page

**Term Rewriting System**

An alternative computational model to a Turing machine.[@zantema_termination_2000]

**TPDB**

Termination Problem Data Base, a collection of problems regarding the Termination of Term Rewriting.

**Type Inference**

Automatic detection of a type of a certain expression.

**URI**

Uniform Resource Identifier, an identifier for certain resources especially for the world wide web.

**URL**

Uniform Resource Locator, a subset of URIs used for web-sites.

**WAI**

Web Application Interface, a general interface to write web servers with Haskell.[^wai]

[^wai]: see http://www.yesodweb.com/book/web-application-interface

**Warp**

A fast web-server used by the Yesod Web Framework programmed in Haskell.

**Yesod Web Framework**

A web framework programmed in Haskell and initially founded by Micheal Snoyman.[@snoyman_developing_2012]
